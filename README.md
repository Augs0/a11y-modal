# A11y modal 1.0

This basic modal showcases how we can make modals more accessible, but still have issues.

I used [this guide from Hidde de Vries](hiddedevries.nl) to replicate a modal that tracks use of tab and shift.
As discussed in the article and in further reading from the article, this isn't a fix-all - particulalry in regards to screen readers.

I plan to add a a11y modal 2.0 shortly that employs the library [ally.js](https://allyjs.io/getting-started.html) to examine if there are better alternatives out there!
